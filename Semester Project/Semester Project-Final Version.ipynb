    "# Final Project: An Improved Attempt at Modeling the Trajectory of a Golf Ball via Curve Fitting using Drag and the Magnus Effect \n",
    "## By Will Frondorf\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "By using the following program, users can see how a hypothetical golf shot will travel given different factors, such as air resistance, drag, wind, weather conditions, and the Magnus Effect. A main part of this program is seeing how wind impacts the trajectory of the ball, particularly at higher altitudes and larger spinrates. This program servers as an investiagtion into the Magnus Effect and the impact it has on spinning objects in flight. \n",
    "\n",
    "## An Overview of the Model\n",
    "This Python program makes use of the Runge-Kutta 4 formula, as well as the Magnus Force equation itterated over multiple timesteps. This computational model will take the entered data and plug it into the drag and lift formulas for a golf ball. The drag coefficient of a golf ball is $C_d=\\frac{1}{4}(1+\\frac{1}{1+e^{2v-12}})$ where $v$ is the velocity of the ball in meters per second. The lift coefficient of a golf ball is $C_L=0.55 x S^{0.4}$ where $S$ is the spinrate (the amount of times the ball completes a single rotation per second) of the golf ball. By combining these factors, you can see how the ball moves. Additionally, this program implements the Magnus Effect, which states that a force is exherted on a spinning sphere in flight that deflects the sphere in a direction perpindicular to its spin. For example, a ball with backspin will be deflected upward and a ball with topspin will be deflected downward. The Magnus Force can be calulated using the following formula: $F_{magnus}=\\alpha(\\omega \\times v)$ where $(\\omega \\times v)$ is the cross product of the sphere's rotation $\\omega$ and velocity $v$ multiplied by the constant $\\alpha$, where $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}C_L\\frac{\\rho Ar}{S}$."

Users can edit the initial speed of the ball, launch angles, wind speeds, and much more. After all the input data is read in, both a 2-dimensional graph and a 3-dimensional model are generated showing the trajectory of the golf ball with the user's choice of spin. Alongside the plots, additional data is printed beneath the plots, such as maximum distances and wind speeds. All input data is entered in imperial units (mph, yards, etc.), converted into metric (radians, meters per second, etc.) for all the calculations, and then reconverted into the user's choice of output unit system, either imperial or metric. All output data, including the axes of the plots, are converted into the unit system the user chose in the menu below.\n",

    "The cell below is home to all the magic of what this program does. The various conditionals and user input data is combined in order to calculate the various trajectories. First, the wind speed slider data is read in and the direction of wind is determined. Wind speed is multiplied by the weatherspeed parameter to better simulate wind speeds in the user's selected weather conditions. Next, the launch angle data is read in and the degree angles are converted to radians in the rest of the calcuations. Initial velocity is read in from the user's input and the terrain and weather factors are added to the velocity. This is to simulate hitting the golf ball in different situations, such as the sand of a bunker acting as a high-friction source slowing down movement or the rain of a thunderstorm making the ball or clubface wet, thus reducing speed. Initial positions of the ball and initial direction of motion for the ball are then read in. Then, all six types of trajectories are calculated. Each spinrate is calulated and then imported into the Run_Magnus funtion defined earlier. Then each trajectory is calaculated and imported into an array that stores all the data. Lastly, variables are assigned to the maximum values of each trajectory's three position terms to be output later after the plots.\n",

    "Using the cell below, users can generate the two plots mentioned above. The cell that runs all the calculations and the cell that plots all the data are separated on purpose. All the plotting code uses generic commands that rely on conversion factors and preselected color options based on the user's input. Since all those variables are defined in the cell below, users can easily switch to a different type of spin in the dropdown menu above and then run the plotting cell below without running any other cell. This allows for easy switching between spin types on the fly. However, this only works for changing the type of spin. All other factors (unit system, terrain, swing speed, wind speeds, weather, etc.) must be redefined in the Conditionals Cell below the user inputs if they are changed in the dropdown menus and sliders. \n",

    "## Validation\n",
    "This program implements many factors in the math, so it may be difficult to keep track of what everything does. In order to see the validity of this program, one can consider the physics of what is actually happening. Balls with topspin will travel significantly shorter distances compared to balls with either no spin or backspin. Also, topspin results in a downward force on the ball, causing it to drop more quickly. Balls with backspin will travel further and expirience an upward force, giving it lift. Therefore, balls with backspin travel both further and higher than topspin. You can see this in both the 2D and 3D models, where the blue backspin lines are much larger in the x-axis than their topspin counterpart. Additionally, if the user implements wind, it can be seen in the 3D plot. Wind in specific directions will impact the trajectory of the ball in various ways. For example, if the user implements 15 mph winds the z-axis, they will see a significant bend in the trajectory, especially within the xz-plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "The models generated by this code produce clean, easy to read, and informative plots. As you can see, the models are acurate to how actual golf balls fly through the air with the addition of wind and air resistance. I hope that these plots, and this programas a whole, is useful in your golfing endeavors.\n",

Additionally, I would like to thank Dr. Titus for his aid and skills in debugging and teaching me new code both during the Computational Physics course for which this project was made and his office hours.\n",
