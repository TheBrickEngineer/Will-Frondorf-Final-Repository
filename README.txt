====================WELCOME TO MY REPOSITORY!===================
Welcome to my repository of projects! Within this repository are
different Jupyter Notebook files that I made. These are all 
projects I have made as part of a computational physics class 
I took this past spring. As part of the class, I had to create a
variety of small coding projects in Jupyter Notebook, each one 
describing a different realm of physics and math. Additionally, 
I had a larger project as my final for the course, a program 
with a lot more detail, code, and overall "oomf" compared to the
others. In this repository, you will find two of small projects 
that I completed, as well as the final project. I hope you enjoy
what I have to offer! These all took riduclous amounts of time 
and effort and I am quite pleased with how it all came together.
Feel free to check out everything!

=====================PROJECT 1: BIFURCATION=====================
This project is an example problem taken from the textbook used
in the computational physics course. This program compiles a 
bifurcation diagram of the sine map function: x_(x+1)=rsin(pi*x_n).
Initially, this program creates the map function of the sine map, 
then creates the massive bifurcation diagram that goes along with
it. Finally, the function's Lyapunov Exponent is calculated. This
project was based on another project we did in class, which itself
was inspired by this video on the bifurcation diagram by the 
famous science YouTube channel Veritasium: https://youtu.be/ovJcsL7vyrk

==========PROJECT 2: THE S-I-R MODEL OF DISEASE SPREAD==========
This project is a customizable disease spread model that uses
the S-I-R model of spread. The famous S-I-R model compares the
populations of susceptible, infected, and recovered people who
are all battling some form of disease. My model compares the 
spread of a generic, fictional disease across 4 different buildings
across my university's campus. Each building has different 
environmental factors that impact the spread of disease, either 
hindering or accelerating it. The program is very customizable, 
allowing users to select which building to model, carriers of the
disease (which further alter the spread), population counts, and
much more. Finally, a graph is creating at the end showing the
population changes over a period of time.

===============FINAL PROJECT: GOLF SHOT SIMULATOR===============
The final and biggest project of the class that I did is the 
golf shot simulator. Named in honor of my professor, this 
program takes copious amounts of input data from a variety of
UIs to determine a single shot on a golf course. This program
is an exercise in aerodynamics, making use of the Magnus Effect,
drag, and the Runge-Kutta 4 method of iteration to plot an
accurate golf shot given all the user's inputs. Everything from
type of golf club, spinrate, weather, wind, swing speed, and much
more can be customized. Data is output into both a 2-dimensional
graph and 3-dimensional plot using matplotlib. This program is so
customizable, users can even select if they wish to save the 2D
graph as PNG file, and colors and output unit data are all tailored
to the user's inputs. By far the most vital and important part
of this program was the main physics concept at play: spin.
User's can select what type of spin they wish to model (backspin,
topspin, sidespin, and spiraling), the trajectories with said
spin will be calculated using input data, the Magnus Effect, and 
drag. If you want to model a gold shot with the most accurate
(or nonsensical) inputs and traits and see how it flies, make 
sure to give the T.I.T.U.S. a try!
